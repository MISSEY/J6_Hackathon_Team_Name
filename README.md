# Problem Statement

Define problem statement (not more than 250 words).

For Example: Voice recognition applications are designed to facilitate the usage of various technologies such as smartphones for instance. However, this technology is not suitable for all members of our community. Hhearing impaired individuals, for explample, can not use voice recognition to manipulate a device from a certain distance. Therefore, we like to apply object recognition to tackle this issue. With our applictaion, we want to explore in how far sign language can be used to maniupulate technologies that are used in everday life. 

# Solution

* Steps taken for solving the problem.
* Frameworks/Tools/Technologies stacks used.
* Give insights into why you chose the particular technology. Therefore, please elaborate on the assumptions you made and explain the constraints of the used technology.

# Methodology 

Explain the following in detail:
  * Explain the architecture of your project. To visualise your architecture, you might provide a flow chart, wireframes or any other graphical representation. 
  * Explain which datasets you used in the project. 
  * Explain which machine learning models you used.
  * Performance metrics: Highlight how well your application performs. For example, you should state the accuracy, loss , etc.

# System Architecture proposal (if any)

Explain the following in detail:
  * Explain which hardwares are used in the project and how the interaction between them is established. 
  * Explain how your architecture works by using for example ER diagram, data flow diagram or integration proposal. You might explain how the connection between different modules is established.


# Working Prototype

* Attach link of working prototype video here in the markdown.

# Screenshots, if needed

* Attach relevant screenshots, if needed. 

# Steps to run the software

* Explain in detail how one can run your software and what steps are needed to do so.
* Explain what libraries need to be installed.
* Explain how to setup an executable environment.
